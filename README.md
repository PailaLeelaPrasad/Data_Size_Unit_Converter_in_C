# Data_Size_Unit_Converter_in_C

This C program converts data sizes from bytes to kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes. It prompts the user for a size in bytes, then calculates and displays the equivalent sizes in each unit. The conversions assume 1 KB = 1024 B, 1 MB = 1024 KB, and 1 GB = 1024 MB. The program provides a simple tool to understand data sizes in different units, aiding in data representation and manipulation.
